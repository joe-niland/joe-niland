I run a [software development & DevOps consultancy in Sydney, Australia](https://originalmind.com.au). We **create business software**, staff and structure development teams, and help our clients build and run **secure Cloud infrastructure** in AWS.

My areas of specialisation are:
- Software architecture and design
- Staffing and running software development projects
- Software development using frameworks such as: Laravel/Vue, ASP.NET (C#)/Blazor, Flask and more
- Serverless event-driven applications
- CI/CD
- IaC with Terraform
- Xero integration

Aside from my main work, I ❤️ working on open source. I am an active [member](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/people?query=role%3Amember) of the awesome [CloudPosse](https://github.com/cloudposse) GitHub org, actively reviewing and submitting PRs to their Terraform module projects.
