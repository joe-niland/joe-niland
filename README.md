#### About Me

I am a Software Engineer from Sydney, Australia with many years of industry experience. 
I have worked in a variety of roles, including: Software Developer, Software Architect, Team Lead, 
DevOps Engineer, and (fractional) CTO.

I provide [software engineering consulting services](https://www.originalmind.com.au) to startups and 
scale-ups, helping them to build, run and scale their software products.

In recent years, I have built a great team of developers and testers. Our main specialisations are:
- the [rapid development](https://www.sydney.software/services/custom-software-development/) of web applications, and
- development of [finance automation solutions](https://www.sydney.software/services/finance-automation/).

I have always had a keen interest in automation, which has led me to build skills in CI/CD, IaC,
scripting, and serverless application development. I provide 
[DevOps consulting services](https://www.originalmind.com.au), helping
businesses optimise software delivery and infrastructure costs.

My areas of specialisation are:
- Software architecture and design
- Staffing and running software development projects
- Software development using frameworks such as: Laravel/Vue, ASP.NET (C#)/Blazor, Flask and more
- Serverless event-driven applications
- CI/CD
- IaC with Terraform
- API integrations (especially Xero)

Aside from my main work, I ❤️ working on open source. I am an active [member](https://github.com/orgs/cloudposse/people?query=role%3Amember) of the awesome [Cloud Posse](https://github.com/cloudposse) GitHub org, actively reviewing and submitting PRs to their Terraform module projects.
